        Figure 1: Job advertisement for a senior programmer for Tantalus Media
        (Seek 2022).
      </p>

      <h2>Job description and why it appeals to me</h2>

      <p>
        Tantalus Media is seeking an experienced game programmer with a strong
        knowledge of the C++ and C# programming languages, and the Unreal and
        Unity game engines, to assist them in the development of high quality,
        AAA standard video games. This person will work closely with the other
        departments of the company, in a team environment, to implement the
        games features using their experience in these above-mentioned skills.
        Some of the tasks the successful candidate will be required to perform
        as part of their duties include testing, debugging, refining, optimizing
        and maintaining the games code for both PC and console versions. They
        will be expected to maintain up-to-date knowledge of all the relevant
        technologies and architectures in their field, and to assist or mentor
        their fellow programmers where needed with their knowledge in their area
        of expertise.
      </p>

      <p>'Tantalus job description, refer to figure 1'</p>

      <p>
        There are many reasons why this role in particular appeals to me. Having
        worked for both small and large companies in the past, I can say without
        a doubt that I much prefer working for the latter. While small companies
        have their benefits, I feel there is more room to grow and move up or
        across the ladder while working for a larger organisation, and I like
        the dynamics of working with a larger group of people and the defined
        structure that comes with it. The added job security and increased
        networking opportunities available would also be a firm positive. With
        Tantalus Media being a mid-sized company, that already has an
        established history of producing top quality, AAA games, I feel like
        this job ticks all my boxes and would be a better fit for me than
        working with a small, niche team, developing indie-type games with
        little to no budget.
      </p>

      <p>
        I would take great satisfaction and pride in having my product reach a
        larger audience and feel this would be my best chance to make an impact
        in the industry. Video games are something that I have always been
        passionate about, with many of my earliest and most cherished memories
        and friendships coming from those experiences, so the opportunity to
        work in this industry and create my own piece of gaming history would be
        a dream. I also have a tendency to get bored easily, so a career in
        something that is both challenging and ever-changing would be ideal for
        me. Even the aspect of working in Brisbane, with the gorgeous weather,
        in a buzzing hip town, sounds great when compared to the cold, rainy
        suburbs of Melbourne where I live now!
      </p>

      <h2>Skills, qualifications and experience required for the position</h2>

      <p>
        When talking about the required skills for this job, obviously one thing
        that can't be overlooked is the technical aspect and experience needed
        to successfully apply. You won't get far in a game programming job
        without the necessary knowledge and experience with all the required
        tooling and languages. You will need to have strong proficiency in C++
        and C#, as these are the most commonly used languages in game
        programming. A huge part of this programming is problem solving, and to
        be successful, you need to be able to do more than just follow
        instructions and write code. Some things don't have pre-defined answers,
        you need to be innovative and able to think up solutions to problems by
        yourself.
      </p>

      <p>
        As well as being able to write the code, it needs to be well structured,
        and maintained, as working in large teams means not only you will be
        working on the project. Thus, other people need to be able to clearly
        interpret what you have done and why you have done it. Like any job,
        your communication and interpersonal skills need to be top notch,
        friendly and professional if you're going to be an effective member of a
        team, something that is often overlooked by some looking to get into a
        career in IT. Setting and meeting deadlines are incredibly important in
        the gaming industry too, as budgets are often stretched thin, stakes are
        often high with many invested parties and time is precious, so it is
        something that you need to be able to meet and do independently. Though
        not absolutely required, it would be advantageous to have the ability to
        learn unfamiliar codebases and skills quickly, as well as have a
        background interfacing with 3D art applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        As for qualifications, they are seeking somebody that has completed at
        least a bachelor's degree in computer science or engineering or has the
        relevant proven experience in all the areas listed above. As this is a
        senior role, they would prefer somebody with at least 5 years'
        experience. Lastly, they want somebody who is passionate about games. A
        person who is enthusiastic about the job they are doing, will often
        offer a lot more to the plate than somebody who is just going through
        the motions and getting the job done. You're probably not going to be
        innovative, at the forefront and go the extra mile if you're not
        passionate about what you're doing.
      </p>

      <h2>Skills, qualifications and experience I already have</h2>

      <p>
        While I don't have any of the qualifications required or experience and
        knowledge with the technical side of things just yet, there are some
        skills I already possess from my past work and life history that will
        put me in good stead for one day being able to acquire this dream job.
        For one, I have always been very meticulous when it comes to the way
        things are organised, as well as in proofreading and formatting, which
        is very handy to have when writing and maintaining code.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have often been told that my communications skills are excellent, as
        this is something I value highly in my everyday relationships as well as
        in the workplace. I take great care when it comes to written
        communication, as I always want to ensure that the message that is in my
        head is exactly what I'm getting across in writing. I feel like I have a
        very friendly and easy-going personality, although I'm not afraid to
        speak up or take leadership when required, which is beneficial to a team
        environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        I love problem-solving and puzzles and will often get obsessed with
        things until I have figured out not only a solution, but the best one
        available. Most importantly, I am passionate about the gaming industry,
        having grown up and participated in it my whole life, and would relish
        the chance to be a part of it.
      </p>

      <h2>Plan to obtain requirements for the position</h2>

      <p>
        To one day obtain a position such as this, the area I need to focus on
        most is the skills and qualifications, though I am already on the right
        track. Firstly, I am going to focus the next 5 years on getting my
        bachelor's degree here at RMIT. I am more interested in the computer
        science side of things, so a switch over from the IT degree will be
        something I need to investigate as I move further into my studies.
      </p>

      <p>
        As for the skills, I am hoping to learn the required programming
        languages over the next few years here at university, as well as in my
        own time. This is something I have already started dabbling in. I am
        quite interested in emulation and participate in the AzerothCore World
        of Warcraft community
        <a href="https://www.azerothcore.org/">(Azerothcore site)</a>. I have
        mostly been helping to debug modules and editing my own SQL databases,
        but as my knowledge increases it will be a good way to test my hand at
        game programming, as modules are written in C++, and I can see the
        results in-game.
      </p>

      <p>
        Aside from that, I will need to investigate building my own portfolio
        over time to showcase my experience. Whether that be through
        internships, group work or creating my own projects, this is something I
        will look to add to as the years progress. My GitHub account will be a
        good tool for managing this. Networking will also be important, as you
        can't wait around for opportunities to fall in your lap. Hopefully this
        can be achieved throughout my time here at university, through the
        classmates I meet, the projects we do and connections I make.
