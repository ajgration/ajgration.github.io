      <h1>Interest in IT</h1>

      <h2>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h2>

      <p>
        My interest in IT began at a very young age, probably as young as 2 or 3
        years old, with devices such as a Windows 95 PC, television, the
        Gameboy, and SNES. For as long as I can remember, I have been captivated
        by technology in one way or another, having either a device in my hand,
        or a screen to sit in front of. As a shy, introverted kid growing up in
        a broken home, I think the thing that interested me most about
        technology back then was the escape it offered from reality, and the
        ability to explore and become enveloped in new and exciting worlds.
      </p>

      <p>
        Going into my teenage years, and now as an adult, this is an interest
        which has only continued to be piqued. I feel privileged to have grown
        up alongside an age of incredible technological advancement. Seeing the
        birth and progression of the internet, where we are now all connected
        with one another, to smartphones becoming extensions of ourselves, and
        the giant leaps in gaming and animation we've made, going from 2D pixels
        to hyper-realistic 3D worlds. Modern technology is just incredible. What
        the future has in store is just as exciting to me though. Seeing the
        advancements being made in robotics and AI, where fields like virtual
        reality are currently heading, to even things such as self-driving cars,
        and tech which can read your brainwaves and produce images or actions
        based on your thoughts. I look to the future with starry eyes and wonder
        about the implications this will have on humankind and know that this is
        a world that I want to be a part of shaping.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?
        Outline your IT experience.
      </h2>

      <p>
        The people in my life which first sparked my interest in IT were my
        parents, and my two uncles, one of which has always been more of a big
        brother to me due to our small age gap. Some of my only happy memories
        of my parents being together were those where we spent gaming as a
        family. It was wanting to share that experience with them that got me
        started in the world of technology. This continued with my younger
        uncle, who took me under his wing and kept me up to date with all the
        latest tech, whether that was gaming consoles, music players, phones or
        toys. My older uncle is who helped begin my fascination with the world
        of PCs. Whether that was teaching me DOS commands to run certain
        programs, how to troubleshoot problems, how to format and reinstall
        Windows, build machines, or things like burning and torrenting, I learnt
        an abundance from him. As such, I owe both my uncles a lot when it comes
        to my current knowledge and interest in IT today.
      </p>

      <p>
        I wouldn't call my experience in IT vast in a technical sense, despite
        my life-long use. I've often been the "computer guy" for my friends and
        family, and I do love the problem-solving aspect and reward that comes
        with troubleshooting problems for yourself, or with building a new
        machine and choosing new devices. I'm somewhat knowledgeable on computer
        hardware, but it is the software side of things where I am keen to
        expand on my limited knowledge, specifically in programming and how
        things work behind the scenes.
      </p>

      <h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>

      <p>
        The truth of the matter is, my choice in RMIT wasn't one in which I
        specifically sought out the university, but rather it was suggested to
        me. I had decided to go back and attempt university studies and that OUA
        was the pathway I would take. I knew I wanted to study IT, but I didn't
        know the specific area I wanted to study in. From there my
        representative outlined a few different degree options and suggested
        RMIT as it had different pathways I could take after completing the
        introduction units. After some research into the course and asking a
        friend who'd studied web development here at RMIT about his experience,
        I concluded that this was the best option for me.
      </p>

      <p>
        The reason behind me coming back to do university level studies at RMIT
        is as stated earlier. I have always had an interest in IT, with it being
        something that has come rather naturally to me, and I would like to get
        the appropriate qualifications, skills and knowledge to forge a
        successful career in the IT industry. I want to be part of the future of
        tech, and I believe RMIT will help me in achieving this goal.
      </p>

      <h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>

      <p>
        I have already learnt a little of what I had expected to learn during my
        studies here at RMIT, mainly about the many different roles available in
        the industry, and that I quite enjoy the logic and problem-solving
        challenges that come with programming. I had hoped that from this course
        I would have a better idea of what IT careers are out there, what those
        roles entail, the skills I'll need, and a clear goal for the path I'd
        like to head down and how to achieve it. Along with this, as stated
        above, learning the appropriate qualifications, skills and knowledge to
        succeed in multiple IT sectors.
