      <p>Hello world!</p>

      <p>
        My name is Aaron, I'm 29 years old and I was born right here in
        Australia, down in the SE suburbs of Melbourne, where I currently still
        reside. My family is originally of English, Irish, German and French
        descent, but on both sides of the tree, we have been here in Australia
        for at least 6 or 7 generations now. I have only travelled abroad to New
        Zealand thus far, and only know how to speak English. Learning another
        language is something I would love to do some day though, and I can't
        wait to visit countries in Asia and Europe, such as the UK and Japan.
      </p>

      <p>
        My education history is a somewhat spotted one to date. I completed year
        12 VCE back in 2010, and since then have studied a couple of different
        courses through TAFE, the first being game design/animation and later
        accounting. Unfortunately, I never progressed far into either of these
        fields, as I have always struggled to find the drive and a real calling
        to go after in my professional life. This is my first attempt at
        university level studies, in a field that has always captivated my
        interest, and I am hopeful for a positive result after having reached a
        certain level of maturity and experience in my life.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my work life, I have held a multitude of rather mundane, unnoteworthy
        roles to date, with most of my experience being in the fields of
        administration, cleaning and warehousing. My current role is in retail,
        where I currently work 2-3 days a week. It's not where I'd ultimately
        like to be, but it pays the bills, and provides the flexibility I need
        in my life to do things such as study this course.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of work and study, I'm usually quite a private person. I love my
        sports, with some of my favourites being soccer, AFL and cricket, and
        I'm a massive Manchester United fan, having watched most every game live
        since about the age of 15. It's my dream to go to Old Trafford one day
        and watch a game in the flesh. I've always been an avid gamer, although
        I tend to mostly play older games nowadays like HoMM3, Diablo 2, RL and
        (classic) WoW. I've got a fondness for music and movies from the 80s,
        and my friends and family like to joke that I'm a bit of an old man, so
        I guess you could say that I'm quite old fashioned and nostalgic. I
        don't get out a whole heap, but when I do, I enjoy going on adventures
        with my 3 dogs, Lily, Teddy and Kewpie, and my girlfriend, Ebony. We're
        both foodies, so good recommendations on places to eat are always most
        welcome!
      </p>

      <p>
        An interesting fact about myself is that I lived in New Zealand,
        specifically Christchurch, for about 2.5 years between 2012-2015.
        Thankfully, this was after the massive earthquakes that destroyed a lot
        of the city in 2011, but I still had to live through the aftermath, and
        with the anxiety that it could happen again at any moment when we felt a
        mild shake. Piles of rubble, rundown buildings and gaping holes in the
        earth where skyscrapers once stood were commonplace, and there were
        entire suburbs which had been condemned due to rising sediment and
        marshlands. That wasn't to say it was a bad time in my life though. It
        wasn't always easy, but the country in general was beautiful, and the
        people welcoming, even if they bantered me for being an Aussie. So
        overall, I look back on my time there fondly and can't wait to go back
        again.

        Here are some photos of myself and all the gorgeous girls who I'm lucky
        to share my life with, out and about on our adventures.
