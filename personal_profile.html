      <h2>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h2>

      <p>
        For the most part, I agree with the results of these 3 tests. After
        reading all 16 options, I feel that the ISFJ personality type most
        deeply resonates with me, especially the “defender” tag, as I am always
        looking after those that I care about before myself. I have always had
        an acute sense of hearing and the ability to regurgitate information I
        hear back with proficient accuracy, so I am not surprised to learn I'm
        an auditory learner either. In comparison to the other two, the “Big
        Five” test did not display all the results I was expecting. Most
        specifically with how high I scored on agreeableness. That gave my
        girlfriend and I quite the chuckle.
      </p>

      <p>
        Personally though, I've always taken tests such as these with a grain of
        salt. Although they can provide some interesting insights into certain
        parts of your personality, or teach you a thing or two about yourself, I
        feel like people try and look too deeply into their meaning and try to
        shoehorn themselves into a box of “I am this” or “I am that” in their
        search for an identity or sense of belonging. I have always viewed
        people as diverse individuals. No two of us are exactly alike, and even
        though we can share many, if not all the same traits, we will still be
        completely different individuals, with our own unique life experiences.
        That is what makes us human, and that is what makes us all remarkable.
      </p>

      <h2>
        How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?
      </h2>

      <p>
        From these results, there are a few behaviours I will have to be careful
        of slipping into, but also some strengths that I will be able to bring
        to the table in a team environment. Low self-discipline is one of the
        biggest downfalls I have, which can be disastrous when in a group
        setting and people are relying on you. However, this should be countered
        by my strong altruistic desire of not wanting to let those in my team
        down. Being highly introverted, I may tend to stay in my shell and not
        reach out as much as I should. It does make me a great listener though,
        and I will always put a lot of thought into my responses and be
        empathetic with the ideas of those around me. Being quite agreeable, I
        should have an easy time getting along with my team members and going
        with the consensus. I'll just have to be mindful not to get too
        emotional and take things personally if things aren't going to plan or I
        don't agree with a change. If work isn't getting done though, I will
        pick up the slack and take on more than I should, which could be viewed
        as good or bad depending on who you ask.
      </p>

      <h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>

      <p>
        The biggest key factor in being successful when forming a team for me
        will be in maintaining strong communication throughout the process.
        Being a more auditory learner, verbal communications through meetings on
        software such as Teams, will be a great form of keeping in touch and up
        to date, as well as keeping me from being too introverted and staying in
        my shell. Frequent contact with my team members will also be the best
        way to keep me engaged and stop me from slacking off due to my poor
        self-discipline. Therefore, to get the best out of myself I should seek
        out a group with a highly organised, passionate leader, as I am quite
        hardworking when given clear direction and held accountable. If everyone
        in my team is unorganised and poor communicators, I may feel pressured
        into taking on too much work by myself.
