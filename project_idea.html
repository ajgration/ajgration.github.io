      <h1>Project Idea</h1>

      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        With my ideal job being in game development, for my project I have
        chosen to create a game which combines elements of some of my favourite
        oldies, most specifically in the real time strategy (RTS) and action
        role-playing game (ARPG) genres. The idea is to create a game which
        plays and feels like an isometric dungeon crawler (Diablo-esque) game in
        terms of UI, character abilities, character progression, combat, enemy
        AI and control, but is structured similar to a competitive RTS/MOBA
        game, with heavy elements of resource gathering, city building, unit
        building/control, customization and replayability. Instead of having a
        permanent character you build up over time, games will be played in
        mostly medium/long matches where you start from scratch, with the focus
        being on player vs player while also maintaining strong player vs
        monster elements. The world will be set in a dungeons and dragons like
        fantasy setting, with appropriate race and class options available to
        the player. The idea is that each game is fast-paced and unique, to keep
        players engaged and coming back for more.
      </p>

      <h2>Motivation</h2>

      <p>
        My motivation behind creating this project is to bring something that
        feels familiar enough to most but offers a new spin on two outdated
        genres which have been stagnant for quite some time and fits more in the
        current market of fast paced, action oriented, battle royale gameplay.
        Player vs player is something which has been dead in the ARPG isometric
        dungeon crawler genre pretty much since Diablo 2 in the early 2000s, and
        the RTS genre has become more and more niche over the years, with fewer
        players committed to playing long, complicated games, and many of its
        fans being from older generations. It's quite telling that the biggest
        games and releases in these genres today are rehashes of ones that are
        many years old (Diablo 2 Resurrected, Age of Empires 2 Definitive), and
        are still very much rooted in the mechanics of the early 2000s. With my
        project, I hope to attract a newer, younger generation of players and
        offer some innovation where it is desperately needed.
      </p>

      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>
        While the individual systems and technologies themselves aren't game
        changing, my goal is that by combining them in a new and innovative way,
        I can bring these elements together to create a successful game. The
        systems and gameplay are what is most going to set my game apart, so
        those are what I'll delve into here, with the first being the game
        world. My aim is that each game will feel different from the last, even
        if you make all the same choices, and the first step to achieving this
        is to have a procedurally generated map, with common reoccurring
        elements such as biomes, creatures and dungeons, set up in a slightly
        labyrinthine, difficulty scaling layout, to make it more challenging for
        players to simply rush each other and have the game end in a few
        minutes. Maps will come in various sizes and contain 2-4 players, either
        human or AI, starting them in opposite areas, with a base consisting of
        a main capitol, their chosen hero, a starting companion and the same
        basic resources and surroundings.
      </p>

      <p>
        To manage controlling a hero in a diablo-esque ARPG style game, while
        also having elements of city building and defending, a clear system will
        need to be put in place to handle this. I intend for the camera to be an
        isometric view and the player to control their character in a point and
        click style with various key-bindings for their abilities. This should
        also be achievable with a controller for console compatibility, using
        the joystick to move around. There needs to be a way to detach your
        camera from your character to look around the map and to snap to your
        capitol building, which will control all your upgrading and unit
        building. Thus, the AI combat system will have to be proficient when
        you're not directly controlling your character, perhaps with options to
        fight, stay or patrol and a mini-map warning system that will help keep
        players informed. I foresee this being quite tricky to implement while
        still feeling smooth and fluent, so a lot of work will need to go into
        this system.
      </p>

      <p>
        Races, classes, character talents and unit and companion choices are
        what will add deeper levels of customization to my game. My idea is that
        players will have a choice from many different races, ranging from the
        “good” races such as humans and elves to the “evil” ones such as orcs
        and undead. Each of these races will come with their own unique perks,
        units, upgrades and strategies. This may create a difficult issue with
        balancing, therefore the number of races and the power of their
        individual traits will need to be closely assessed. To make this
        balancing slightly less complex, classes and their abilities will be
        more streamlined and available to all races. Customization within these
        classes will come from two aspects, talent trees and items. For example,
        a player playing a mage might choose to focus on fire, or ice, or
        lightning magic, or a mixture of all of these. Each talent tree will
        provide greater power with the more you invest into it, as well as game
        changing or character defining abilities being found further into the
        trees. Points to spend in these will be limited based on experience
        gained killing players and monsters in the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second form of class customization will come from the items you find
        and will play a huge part in defining your character. Basic items you
        find early on might provide simple stat boosts, or minor abilities such
        as a small heal on hit. More powerful items will be gated behind strong
        enemies and dungeons, located on the more outer reaches of the map and
        provide game-changing, build defining effects, such as new abilities or
        huge damage boosts. I intend for these most powerful items to be very
        much a risk vs reward choice for the player and require a considerable
        amount of time, experience and resources to go after, which may leave
        them vulnerable if their opponent prioritises other things.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gameplay is where I hope my project offers a unique experience. The idea
        of the game is to traverse the map, collecting resources and leveling up
        by gaining experience killing monsters as you explore. Along the way you
        will also raid dungeons, which are side areas separate from the main map
        that vary in power, for items and resources. Once defeated, dungeons are
        captured and act as outposts to give you a tactical advantage in what
        you can see on the map.
      </p>

      <p>
        Units come in different power levels and costs and have two purposes.
        You can set them to defend your capitol or assign them to raid a dungeon
        with or without your assistance. Companions are powerful race-themed
        units, each fitting a unique role such as healing, buffing or damage
        dealing, and having their own experience and upgradable abilities. They
        are attached to the player and can be lightly commanded, with a maximum
        limit of 3 in your party. They can be interchanged and recruited, and
        can also be equipped with items, though fewer slots are available to
        them. There is a cap on the number of units you can have at once, and
        their deaths are permanent. However, players and companions will respawn
        at their capitol on death, with an incremental delay timer based on how
        many times they have died recently.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your capitol is the base hub of your operation and consists of a main
        building, defence towers and walls depending on your upgrade status. All
        resources and items found from dungeons are stored here. It is also
        where you recruit new units and companions and make all your upgrades.
        The game is as much about offense as it is defence, as if your capitol
        falls to the enemy, you will be unable to create new units or respawn,
        meaning your next death is permanent. So, to win, you must defeat your
        enemy's capitol, and eliminate them from the map.
      </p>

      <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>

      <p>
        To create a game of this size and complexity, several tools and
        technologies will be needed in a variety of areas. Documentation,
        planning and worldbuilding are just as important as the engine, so a
        good workspace tool to brainstorm and take down ideas such as Nuclino or
        Obsidian will help keep things organised. As for engines, there are a
        few options that meet the criteria. For 2D or 3D, tools such as Unity,
        Unreal Engine or Godot could be used, with each having their pros and
        cons. Unreal might make prettier 3D games but is more complex and not as
        good with 2D as Unity is. However, Unreal has the added bonus of being
        free to use.
      </p>

      <p>
        Character design, modelling and animation tools will be needed to create
        the games characters and bring them to life. These could include popular
        software such as Maya or 3ds Max from Autodesk, or a free open-source
        alternative in Blender. Photoshop could be used in creating other visual
        assets for the game. A source control tool will be useful to backup code
        and allow multiple people to work on the project simultaneously, while
        providing a history of changes. The industry standard for this is
        Perforce, though Git or Subversion would be suitable as well. As for
        technologies, a powerful computer will be needed as rendering models
        uses a lot of processing power. I would also want the game to be
        compatible with consoles as well as PC, so the relevant devkits and
        licences would be required for testing.

      <h2>Skills Required</h2>

      <p>
        There are a lot of skills, and often teamwork required when it comes to
        creating a successful game. C++ and C# are the most used programming
        languages in game development, so a strong knowledge of these will be
        needed to code the many different aspects of the game. This requires a
        large amount of problem solving and creativity, as you are bound to run
        into hurdles trying to meet the game design criteria. A strong
        analytical mind and foundation in mathematics will also be needed to
        finely balance the various mechanics and systems in the game. Artistic
        ability will be needed in creating the models for the game, as will
        experience using modelling and image editing software. In terms of
        feasibility, some of the elements, such as planning, character design
        and worldbuilding, will most definitely be achievable by first year
        students. However, the more technical aspects such as programming would
        most likely need to be outsourced, or better investigated further down
        the line.

      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>
        For me, a successful outcome will be a game that not only runs well but
        is enjoyed by those who play it. My goal is that it attracts a new kind
        of player base to the genre, though even if it doesn't take off, I hope
        it provides what is becoming a niche community something fresh and
        exciting to dig their claws into and perhaps spurs other developers into
        creating new innovative ideas in the genre.
